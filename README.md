# Mixture Density Networks

## ðŸ’Ž About
Mixture density networks (Bishop, 1994) allow for flexible modeling of mixture models by having the components and the component densities be complex functions of the input. This is particularly useful for inverse problems, where the desired conditional probability is multimodal (e.g. inverse kinematics, mapping symptoms to diseases; any one-to-many problem).
